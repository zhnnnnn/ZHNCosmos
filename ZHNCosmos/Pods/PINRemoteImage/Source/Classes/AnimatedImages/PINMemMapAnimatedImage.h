/**
 PINMemMapAnimatedImage is a class which decodes GIFs to memory mapped files on disk. Like PINRemoteImageManager,
 it will only decode a GIF one time, regardless of the number of the number of PINMemMapAnimatedImages created with
 the same NSData.
 
 PINMemMapAnimatedImage's are also decoded chunks at a time, writing each chunk to a separate file. This allows callback
 and playback to start before the GIF is completely decoded. If a frame is requested beyond what has been processed,
 nil will be returned. Because a fileReady is called on each chunk completion, you can pause playback if you hit a nil
 frame until you receive another fileReady call.
 
 Internally, PINMemMapAnimatedImage attempts to keep only the files it needs open â€“ the last file associated with the requested
 frame and the one after (to prime).
 
 It's important to note that until infoCompletion is called, it is unsafe to access many of the methods on PINMemMapAnimatedImage.
